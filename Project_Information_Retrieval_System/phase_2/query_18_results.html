<b><u>CACM-2138</u></b><br /><b>BLISS: A Language for Systems Programming</b><br />prime design goals of the design are the ability to produce <b>highly</b> efficient object <b>code</b>  to allow access to all relevant hardware features of the host machine and to provide a rational means  by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems programs .this language is designed so as to be <b>especially</b> suitable  for use in writing production software systems for a specific machine the pdp-10 <b>compilers</b> operating  systems etc .<br /><b><u>CACM-2714</u></b><br /><b>Merging with Parallel Processors</b><br />the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p <b>parallel</b> <b>processors</b>  which requires at most 2   steps .these performances compare very favorably with the previous best <b>parallel</b> merging algorithm  batchers algorithm which requires np  mn2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp  k12mplog2  m in the special case where nkm .<b>parallel</b> processing <b>parallel</b> merging <b>parallel</b> binary insertion  5 .<br /><b><u>CACM-1665</u></b><br /><b>Automatic Generation of Efficient Lexical
Processors Using Finite State Techniques</b><br />if the word events is substituted for character string  these <b>processors</b> may be described as generalized decision-making mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence  of events .lexical <b>processors</b>  for aed-o and mad are among the many which have been produced .in designing a system for automatic generation of a lexical processor the goal was a processor which  completely eliminated backup or rereading which was nearly as fast as hand-coded <b>processors</b> which would  analyze the language and detect errors and which would be convenient and easy to use .<br /><b><u>CACM-3110</u></b><br /><b>Assembling Code for Machines with Span-Dependent Instructions</b><br />assembling <b>code</b> for <b>machines</b> with span-dependent instructions  many modern computers contain instructions whose lengths depend on the distance from a given  instance of such an instruction to the operand of that instruction .span-dependent instructions variable-length addressing <b>code</b> generation assemblers <b>compilers</b>  np-complete computational complexity .this paper considers the problem  of minimizing the lengths of programs for such <b>machines</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3156</u></b><br /><b>Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</b><br />we assume that the <b>processors</b> have access to a common memory .an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only nnlog2n <b>processors</b> .graph theory <b>parallel</b> processing algorithms transitive closure connected component  5 .<br />
