<b><u>CACM-2931</u></b><br /><b>Logic and Programming Languages</b><br />the experience of many independent workers  with the method of <b>data</b> <b>types</b> as lattices or partial orderings under an information content ordering  and with their continuous mappings has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach in providing definitions  and proofs which are clean and without undue dependence on implementations .logic and programming languages  logic has been long in terested in whether answers to certain <b>questions</b> are computable in principle  since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization .nevertheless much remains  to be done in showing how <b>abstract</b> conceptualizations can or cannot be actualized before we can say  we have a unified theory .<br /><b><u>CACM-3031</u></b><br /><b>Abstract Data Types and Software Validation</b><br />first it is shown how the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify  the process of proving the correctness of an implementation of an <b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> type .<b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> type correctness proof <b>data</b> type <b>data</b> structure specification   4 .<b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> and software validation  a <b>data</b> abstraction can be naturally specified using algebraic axioms .<br /><b><u>CACM-2470</u></b><br /><b>Fen-An Axiomatic Basis for Program Semantics</b><br />it is shown how the system can be used to build composite  <b>data</b> <b>types</b> out of simper ones with the operations of rowing structuring and uniting .fen-an axiomatic basis for program semantics  a formal system is presented which abstracts the notions of <b>data</b> item function and relation .it is described how the local environment can be modeled as a <b>data</b> item and how imperative statements  can be considered functions on the environment .<br /><b><u>CACM-3105</u></b><br /><b>A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access</b><br />programming languages access control <b>data</b> <b>types</b> <b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> type checking capabilities  4 .the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed  language but is particularly suitable for extending languages that support the notion of <b>abstract</b> <b>data</b>  <b>types</b> .the extension permits expression of access constraints on shared <b>data</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3142</u></b><br /><b>Consumer Difficulties With Computerized Transactions: 
An Empirical Investigation</b><br />how many and what type of errors occur  how easily are they corrected  what is the reaction of consumers to errors-to a failure to correct them  what can be learned by designers of large management packages from such <b>data</b> results show that with the present state of the art approximately 40 percent of individuals or households having average contacts with different <b>types</b> of accounts experience one or more errors per year .<br />
