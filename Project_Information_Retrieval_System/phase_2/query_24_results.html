<b><u>CACM-1696</u></b><br /><b>An Algorithm for Identifying the Ergodic Subchains
and Transient States of a Stochastic Matrix</b><br />applications in markov renewal programming and in the construction of variable length  codes are reviewed and an updating procedure for dealing with certain sequences of <b>stochastic</b> matrices  is discussed .<b>stochastic</b> matrix ergodic chain identification  5 .an algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchains and transient states of a <b>stochastic</b> matrix  an algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchains and transient states of a <b>stochastic</b> matrix is presented .<br /><b><u>CACM-1194</u></b><br /><b>Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation</b><br />the main features of the information system are direct user access via on-line teletypewriter console  direct user access to all details of the system organization unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary  user access through many facets of document indexing and <b>stochastic</b> search through linked index terms  and other file relationships .<br /><b><u>CACM-1410</u></b><br /><b>Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems</b><br />interarrival statistics for time sharing systems  the optimization of time-shared system performance requires the description of the <b>stochastic</b>  <b>processes</b> governing the user inputs and the program activity .<br /><b><u>CACM-2342</u></b><br /><b>Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes</b><br />in this paper a system of parallel <b>processes</b> is regarded as a machine which proceeds  from one state s i .it is shown  how to calculate transition rules from the partial rules by which the individual <b>processes</b> operate .interference between communicating parallel <b>processes</b>  various kinds of interference between communicating parallel <b>processes</b> have been examined by  dijkstra knuth and others .<br /><b><u>CACM-2882</u></b><br /><b>A Stochastic Evaluation Model for Database
