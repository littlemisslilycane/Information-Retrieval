<b><u>CACM-2990</u></b><br /><b>Effective Information Retrieval Using Term Accuracy</b><br /><b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>indexing</b> content analysis term accuracy frequency weighting  thesaurus and phrase transformations  3 .effective <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> using term accuracy  the <b>performance</b> of <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems can be evaluated in a number of different  ways .by relating term accuracy to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the  documents of a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a  given user query of a number of <b>automatic</b> <b>indexing</b> systems that have been used successfully in experimental  situations .<br /><b><u>CACM-2711</u></b><br /><b>A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing</b><br /><b>automatic</b> <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>indexing</b> content analysis document space  3 .typical <b>evaluation</b> results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the model .an approach based on  space density computations is used to choose an optimum <b>indexing</b> vocabulary for a collection of documents .<br /><b><u>CACM-1032</u></b><br /><b>Theoretical Considerations in Information Retrieval Systems</b><br />for identification of <b>information</b> the paper suggests that a metalanguage recently discussed  in a paper by goffman verhoeff and belzer associated with an object language be used .theoretical <b>considerations</b> in <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems  <b>information</b> storage and <b>retrieval</b> systems are composed of three major components a identification  of <b>information</b> and tagging it for effective <b>retrieval</b> b searching strategy how to enter the file  to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material and c file organization to make access to <b>information</b>  efficient .for searching  strategy a linear model for an <b>evaluation</b> function of relevancy is developed which rewards the system  for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving the nonrelevant and penalizes the system for the  escaped relevant documents and false drops .<br /><b><u>CACM-0329</u></b><br /><b>Automatic Abstracting and Indexing Survey and Recommendations</b><br />the relative-frequency approach is discussed in detail as is its application to <b>problems</b> of <b>automatic</b>  <b>indexing</b> and <b>automatic</b> abstracting .included in the report is a summary of <b>automatic</b> analysis studies  published as of the date of writing .conclusions are that point toward more sophisticated mathematical  and linguistic techniques for the solution of <b>problems</b> of <b>automatic</b> analysis .<br /><b><u>CACM-1457</u></b><br /><b>Data Manipulation and Programming Problems
in Automatic Information Retrieval</b><br />data manipulation and programming <b>problems</b> in <b>automatic</b> <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b>  <b>automatic</b> <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> programs require the manipulation of a variety of different  data structures including linear text sparse matrices and tree or list structures .the main data  manipulations to be performed in <b>automatic</b> <b>information</b> systems are first briefly reviewed .a variety  of data representations which have been used to describe structured <b>information</b> are then examined and  the characteristics of various processing languages are outlined in the light of the procedures requiring  implementation .<br />
