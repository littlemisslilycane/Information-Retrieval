<b><u>CACM-2035</u></b><br /><b>Conversational Access to a 2048-Word Machine</b><br />techniques  developed for handling scroll <b>editing</b> filing and the layered system  structure are outlined .its <b>design</b> was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in  interviews held with linc users themselves during the specification period .conversational access to a 2048-word machine  lap6 is an on-line system running on a 2048-word linc which provides full  facilities for text <b>editing</b> automatic filing and file maintenance and  program preparation and assembly .<br /><b><u>CACM-1829</u></b><br /><b>An Interactive Graphical Display Monitor in
a Batch-Processing Environment with Remote Entry</b><br />the graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor  which provides comprehensive managerial capability over the graphical system in response to commands  from the <b>human</b> <b>user</b> .thus the <b>human</b> and program can interact on a symmetrical  and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor .the structure  of the monitor program and the <b>human</b> and program <b>interfaces</b> are described .<br /><b><u>CACM-2321</u></b><br /><b>On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems</b><br />communications standard <b>interface</b> communications protocol virtual channel multiplexed inputoutput  coordination of inputoutput  3 .when specifying these <b>interfaces</b>  consideration must be given to problems of coordination synchronization error control signaling stream  multiplexing and switch control in addition to minimizing the technological interdependence of specific  subsystem designs .several standard <b>interfaces</b> by means of which computers and digital  terminals connect to the communications systems will be required .<br /><b><u>CACM-2003</u></b><br /><b>An Interactive Software System for Computers-Aided
Design:  An Application to Circuit Project</b><br />the main emphasis is given to the description of the features of the two high level <b>user</b> oriented languages operating at different levels on which the interaction is based .interaction graphics computer graphics computer-aided <b>design</b> circuit <b>design</b> software system software organization language monitor language graphic language extended fortran  3 .the first one is imol an interactive monitor language which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system its <b>design</b> criteria provide the <b>user</b> with commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in computer-aided circuit <b>design</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2299</u></b><br /><b>An Extensible Editor for a Small Machine with Disk Storage</b><br />such a data structure  is described and its merits are illustrated by the ease with which powerful extensions can be implemented  in terms of a few basic <b>editing</b> function .<b>command</b> processing context searching executive program garbage collection interpreter list  processing macro language paging parameter substitution recursion state table storage allocation  string manipulation text <b>editing</b> virtual memory  3 .an extensible editor for a small machine with disk storage  a <b>design</b> philosophy for developing a sophisticated utility program is illustrated by the actual  <b>design</b> and <b>implementation</b> of a text editor .<br />
