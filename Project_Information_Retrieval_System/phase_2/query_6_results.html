<b><u>CACM-2826</u></b><br /><b>Interactive Skeleton Techniques for Enhancing
Motion Dynamics in Key Frame Animation</b><br />this technique allows an animator to develop a complex <b>motion</b>  sequence by animating a stick figure representation of an image .interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing <b>motion</b> <b>dynamics</b> in key frame animation  a significant increase in the capability for controlling <b>motion</b> <b>dynamics</b> in key frame animation  is achieved through skeleton control .<br /><b><u>CACM-2828</u></b><br /><b>Hierarchical Geometric Models for Visible Surface Algorithms</b><br />finally  the <b>geometric</b> structure suggests a recursive descent visible surface algorithm in which the computation  time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene .visible surface algorithms hidden surface algorithms hierarchical data structures <b>geometric</b>  models  5 .by using an extension of  traditional structure information or a <b>geometric</b> hierarchy five significant improvements to current  techniques are possible .<br /><b><u>CACM-0695</u></b><br /><b>Use of the Disk File on Stretch</b><br />timing  limitations due to <b>arm</b> <b>motion</b> and disk rotation are discussed .<br /><b><u>CACM-2721</u></b><br /><b>The Digital Simulation of River Plankton Population Dynamics</b><br />in addition the study demonstrates the usefulness of digital simulations in the examinations of certain  aquatic ecosystems as well as in environmental <b>planning</b> involving such examinations .the digital simulation of river plankton population <b>dynamics</b>  this paper deals with the development of a mathematical model for and the digital simulation  in fortran iv of phytoplankton and zooplankton population densities in a river using previously developed  rate expressions .as an investigation  of the accuracy of the simulation methods a simulation of the actual population <b>dynamics</b> of asterionella  in the columbia river was made based on approximations of conditions in that river .<br /><b><u>CACM-2931</u></b><br /><b>Logic and Programming Languages</b><br />logic and programming languages  logic has been long in <b>terested</b> in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle  since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization .the definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects  of computation in a way the statics of the problem and how they are to be transformed the <b>dynamics</b> .so far the theories of automata and of nets though most in teresting for <b>dynamics</b> have formalized only  a portion of the field and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic  <b>aspects</b> .<br />
