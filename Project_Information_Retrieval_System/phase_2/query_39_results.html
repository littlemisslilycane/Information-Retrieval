<b><u>CACM-2940</u></b><br /><b>Abstraction and Verification in Alphard: Defining
and Specifying Iteration and Generators</b><br />results are obtained that for common special  cases of these loops are essentially identical to the corresponding constructs in other <b>languages</b> .abstraction and verification in alphard defining and specifying iteration and generators  the alphard form provides the <b>programmer</b> with a great deal of control over the implementation  of <b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> .a means of specializing alphards loops to operate  on <b>abstract</b> entities without explicit dependence on the representation of those entities is in troduced .<br /><b><u>CACM-2651</u></b><br /><b>The Treatment of Data Types in EL1</b><br />the resulting treatment of <b>data</b> <b>types</b> includes provision for  programmer-defined <b>data</b> <b>types</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> and generic routines <b>programmer</b> control over type conversion  and very flexible <b>data</b> type behavior in a context that allows efficient compiled code and compact <b>data</b>  representation .<b>data</b> <b>types</b> modes mode unions type conversion coercion generic functions <b>extensible</b> <b>languages</b>  <b>data</b> type <b>definition</b> <b>data</b> description language compilation  4 .the treatment of <b>data</b> <b>types</b> in el1  in constructing a general purpose programming language a key issue is providing a sufficient  set of <b>data</b> <b>types</b> and associated operations in a manner that permits both natural problem-oriented notation  and efficient implementation .<br /><b><u>CACM-2931</u></b><br /><b>Logic and Programming Languages</b><br />logic and programming <b>languages</b>  logic has been long in terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle  since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization .programming <b>languages</b> offer  an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced however the semantical theory  can hardly be said to be complete .nevertheless much remains  to be done in showing how <b>abstract</b> conceptualizations can or cannot be actualized before we can say  we have a unified theory .<br /><b><u>CACM-3105</u></b><br /><b>A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access</b><br />programming <b>languages</b> access control <b>data</b> <b>types</b> <b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> type checking capabilities  4 .a language extension for expressing constraints on <b>data</b> access  controlled sharing of information is needed and desirable for many applications and is supported  in operating systems by access control mechanisms .this paper shows how to extend programming <b>languages</b>  to provide controlled sharing .<br /><b><u>CACM-3103</u></b><br /><b>Automatic Data Structure Selection: An Example and Overview</b><br />thus the programs produced using <b>abstract</b> <b>types</b> were then inefficient in space or time .<b>abstract</b> <b>data</b> <b>types</b> automatic programming <b>data</b> structures optimizing compilers sets lists  4 .in this paper  a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations for <b>abstract</b> <b>types</b> from a library of implementations  is discussed .<br />
