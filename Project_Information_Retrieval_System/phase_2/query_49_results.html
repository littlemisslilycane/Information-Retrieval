for Information Storage and Retrieval</b><br />algorithms for the organization an d <b>retrieval</b> of <b>information</b> are described .algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given <b>information</b> system are described .the use of normal multiplication tables for <b>information</b> storage and <b>retrieval</b>  this paper describes a method for the organization and <b>retrieval</b> of attribute  <b>based</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> using the normal multiplication table as a directory for the <b>information</b> system .<br /><b><u>CACM-1699</u></b><br /><b>Experimental Evaluation of Information
Retrieval Through a Teletypewriter</b><br />the basic assumption  of the research is that an <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> system that provides for man-machine dialogue at a remote  inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many of the tools which would be available to him were  he actually performing his search at a library or repository of documents .experimental evaluation of <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> through a teletypewriter  experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of mechanized <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b>  with emphasis on interactive man-machine language and on some of the mechanical and psychological limitations  in their design were conducted at the moore school <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> laboratory .<b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> testing  <b>information</b> system evaluation experimental document <b>retrieval</b>  document <b>retrieval</b> document perusal man-machine communication remote console communication teletypewriter  communication remote terminal communication <b>retrieval</b> command language symbolic command language  interactive <b>systems</b> user learning factors on-line searching  3 .<br /><b><u>CACM-2990</u></b><br /><b>Effective Information Retrieval Using Term Accuracy</b><br />effective <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> using term accuracy  the performance of <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> can be evaluated in a number of different  ways .<b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> automatic indexing content analysis term accuracy frequency weighting  thesaurus and phrase transformations  3 .in the present  study <b>retrieval</b> evaluation is <b>based</b> on optimizing the performance of a specific user query .<br /><b><u>CACM-2795</u></b><br /><b>Sentence Paraphrasing from a Conceptual Base</b><br />in generating sentences from meaning structures  the program employs both the <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> and deduction capabilities of the memory model .sentence paraphrasing from a conceptual base  a model of natural language <b>based</b> on an underlying language-free representation of meaning  is described .a program <b>based</b> on this model is able to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate  understanding with respect to a given context .<br /><b><u>CACM-3012</u></b><br /><b>The Use of an Interactive Information Storage
