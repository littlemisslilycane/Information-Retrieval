<b><u>CACM-2289</u></b><br /><b>Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</b><br />in particular several parallelized  <b>algorithms</b> are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree distance and path problems with  direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis and the analysis of many types of networks .the chief computational advantage  offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved by virtue of the possibilities for <b>parallel</b>  processing .these <b>algorithms</b> exhibit a <b>computation</b> time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n  where n is the number of nodes in the graph .<br /><b><u>CACM-3075</u></b><br /><b>Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms</b><br /><b>parallel</b> processing sorting <b>algorithms</b> bucket sort  3 .the model of <b>computation</b> for this procedure permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory  location .fast <b>parallel</b> sorting <b>algorithms</b>  a <b>parallel</b> bucket-sort algorithm is presented that requires time olog n and the use of n  processors .<br /><b><u>CACM-2973</u></b><br /><b>Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Parallel Computer</b><br />the <b>algorithms</b> of this paper are shown to be optimal in time within small constant factors .<b>parallel</b> computer <b>parallel</b> sorting <b>parallel</b> merge routing and comparison steps perfect shuffle .sorting on a mesh-connected <b>parallel</b> computer  two <b>algorithms</b> are presented for sorting n2 elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor  array that require on routing and comparison steps .<br /><b><u>CACM-2266</u></b><br /><b>A Highly Parallel Algorithm for Approximating
