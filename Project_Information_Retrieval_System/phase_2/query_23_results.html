the Exponential and Normal Distributions</b><br />for  the exponential distribution a definite recommendation can be made whereas in the case of the normal  distribution there remains a choice between slower and shorter <b>algorithms</b> and faster but space consuming  methods .the most efficient ones are compared in terms of memory requirements  and speed with some new <b>algorithms</b> .<br />
