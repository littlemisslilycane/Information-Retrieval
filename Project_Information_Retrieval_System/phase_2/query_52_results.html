<b><u>CACM-2721</u></b><br /><b>The Digital Simulation of River Plankton Population Dynamics</b><br />although not totally  accurate the <b>simulation</b> was found to predict the general annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well  and specifically revealed the importance of the annual velocity cycle in determining such patterns .as an investigation  of the accuracy of the <b>simulation</b> methods a <b>simulation</b> of the actual population dynamics of asterionella  in the columbia river was made based on approximations of conditions in that river .in order to study the relationships between the ecological mechanisms involved the  <b>simulation</b> parameters were varied illustrating the response of the ecosystem to different conditions  including those corresponding to certain types of chemical and thermal pollution .<br /><b><u>CACM-1928</u></b><br /><b>Exclusive Simulation of Activity in Digital Networks</b><br /><b>simulation</b> logical <b>simulation</b> digital <b>simulation</b> large systems <b>simulation</b> network structures  scheduling queuing simultaneous activities parallel events  4 .certain aspects  of the techniques described may be used for the <b>simulation</b> of network structures other than digital networks .exclusive <b>simulation</b> of activity in digital networks  a technique for simulating the detailed logic networks of large and active digital systems  is described .<br /><b><u>CACM-1366</u></b><br /><b>Computer Simulation-Discussion of the
Technique and Comparison of Languages </b><br />computer simulation-discussion of the technique and comparison of languages   the purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of some computer <b>simulation</b> languages  and of some of the involved in comparing software packages for digital computers are discussed in part  i .substantial costs can occur particularly in training implementation and computer time if an inappropriate  language is chosenore and more computer <b>simulation</b> languages are being developed comparisons and  evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as users .the second  part is devoted to computer <b>simulation</b> and <b>simulation</b> languages .<br /><b><u>CACM-2749</u></b><br /><b>Significant Event Simulation</b><br />the model aids in choosing between the two <b>simulation</b>  methods for a particular experiment .it is concluded that the significant event method can be of value  in the <b>simulation</b> of some systems when computational efficiency is of sufficient importance .<b>simulation</b> organization event <b>simulation</b> clock pulse <b>simulation</b> significant event <b>simulation</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2767</u></b><br /><b>A Comparison of Simulation Event List Algorithms</b><br />the end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous immediate replacement for the algorithm  in use with current <b>simulation</b> languages .<b>simulation</b> time flow mechanisms event list algorithm <b>simulation</b> time flow mechanisms event  list algorithm <b>simulation</b> executive event scheduling routine discrete system <b>simulation</b> sorting  3 .a comparison of <b>simulation</b> event list algorithms  four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete  <b>simulation</b> system .<br />
