<b><u>CACM-2714</u></b><br /><b>Merging with Parallel Processors</b><br />the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel <b>processors</b>  which requires at most 2   steps .merging with parallel <b>processors</b>  consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel <b>processors</b>  working synchronously .<br /><b><u>CACM-3156</u></b><br /><b>Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</b><br />computing connected components on parallel computers  we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n .we assume that the <b>processors</b> have access to a common memory .an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only nnlog2n <b>processors</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3075</u></b><br /><b>Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms</b><br />the algorithm makes use of a technique that requires more space than the product of <b>processors</b>  and time .fast parallel sorting algorithms  a parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented that requires time olog n and the use of n  <b>processors</b> .a procedure  is also presented to sort n numbers in time ok log n using n 1  1k <b>processors</b> for k an arbitrary  integer .<br /><b><u>CACM-1811</u></b><br /><b>A Case Study in Programming for Parallel-Processors</b><br />parallel-processor  systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the <b>processors</b> can simultaneously execute separate  tasks of a single job thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem .the  <b>processors</b> have independent instruction counters meaning that each processor executes its own task program  relatively independently of the other <b>processors</b> .communication between cooperating <b>processors</b> is by  means of data in storage shared by all <b>processors</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2497</u></b><br /><b>Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts</b><br />the read-interlock method does require a specialread-interlock instruction  in the repertoire of the <b>processors</b> and a special read-interlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory  modules .synchronizing <b>processors</b> with memory-content-generated interrupts  implementations of the lock-unlock method of synchronizing <b>processors</b> in a multiprocessor  system usually require uninterruptable memory-pause type instructions .<br />
