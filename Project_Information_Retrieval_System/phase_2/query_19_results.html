<b><u>CACM-2973</u></b><br /><b>Sorting on a Mesh-Connected Parallel Computer</b><br />the <b>algorithms</b> of this paper are shown to be optimal in time within small constant factors .sorting on a mesh-connected parallel computer  two <b>algorithms</b> are presented for sorting n2 elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor  array that require on routing and comparison steps .<br /><b><u>CACM-3075</u></b><br /><b>Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms</b><br />parallel processing sorting <b>algorithms</b> bucket sort  3 .fast parallel sorting <b>algorithms</b>  a parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented that requires time olog n and the use of n  processors .<br /><b><u>CACM-2289</u></b><br /><b>Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</b><br />a major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the  solution of graph problems is the determination of <b>algorithms</b> that exploit the possibilities for parallelism  especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial .in particular several parallelized  <b>algorithms</b> are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree distance and path problems with  direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis and the analysis of many types of networks .straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known  serial <b>algorithms</b> for these problems require about n steps and noncellular implementations require from  n2 to n3 steps .<br /><b><u>CACM-1601</u></b><br /><b>Parallel Numerical Methods for the Solution of Equations</b><br />in such an environment the procedures  obtained are superior to standard <b>algorithms</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3156</u></b><br /><b>Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</b><br />graph theory parallel processing <b>algorithms</b> transitive closure connected component  5 .<br />
