<b><u>CACM-3139</u></b><br /><b>New Methods to Color the Vertices of a Graph</b><br />np-complete <b>graph</b> structure balancing <b>graph</b> <b>coloring</b> scheduling comparison of the methods  5 .new methods to color the vertices of a <b>graph</b>  this paper describes efficient new <b>heuristic</b> methods to color the vertices of a <b>graph</b> which rely upon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a <b>graph</b> .finally an exact <b>method</b> is given which performs better than the randall-brown algorithm and is able to color larger graphs and the new <b>heuristic</b> methods the classical methods and the exact <b>method</b> are compared .<br /><b><u>CACM-2177</u></b><br /><b>An Algorithm for the Blocks and Cutnodes of a Graph</b><br />algorithm block block-cutpoint-tree cutnode fundamental cycle set <b>graph</b> lobe lobe <b>decomposition</b>  <b>graph</b> separable spanning tree web grammar  5 .if w denotes the word length of the machine employed the storage in machine words required  for a <b>graph</b> with n nodes and m edges increases essentially as 2mn in case i or n2win case  ii .an algorithm for the blocks and cutnodes of a <b>graph</b>  an efficient <b>method</b> is presented for finding blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected  <b>graph</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2289</u></b><br /><b>Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems</b><br />in particular several parallelized  <b>algorithms</b> are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree distance and path problems with  direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis and the analysis of many types of networks .straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known  serial <b>algorithms</b> for these problems require about n steps and noncellular implementations require from  n2 to n3 steps .cellular arrays for the solution of <b>graph</b> problems  a cellular array is a two-dimensional checkerboard type interconnection of identical modules  or cells where each cell contains a few bits of memory and a small amount of combinational logic  and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors in the array .<br /><b><u>CACM-2883</u></b><br /><b>An Application of Heuristic Search Methods to Edge and Contour Detection</b><br />the relations between this representation of  the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed showing that the <b>graph</b> search  <b>method</b> can lead to substantial improvements in computing time .picture processing pattern recognition edge detection contour detection contour following  optimization problems dynamic programming shortest path <b>heuristic</b> search methods problem solving  methods  3 .moreover if <b>heuristic</b> search methods  are used the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture .<br /><b><u>CACM-3156</u></b><br /><b>Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</b><br />computing connected components on parallel computers  we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected <b>graph</b> with n vertices in time olog2n .the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean <b>matrix</b> .<b>graph</b> theory parallel processing <b>algorithms</b> transitive closure connected component  5 .<br />
