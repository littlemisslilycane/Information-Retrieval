<b><u>CACM-1961</u></b><br /><b>An Efficient Search Algorithm to Find the Elementary Circuits of a Graph</b><br />algorithm graph <b>theory</b> circuit search algorithm path search algorithm searching  3 .empirical bounds are presented <b>relating</b> the speed of the algorithm to the number of vertices and the number of arcs .the algorithm can be easily modified to find all of the elementary <b>circuits</b> with a particular attribute such as length .<br /><b><u>CACM-1856</u></b><br /><b>The Teachable Language Comprehender: 
A Simulation Program and Theory of Language</b><br />the memory structure  and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertions and capabilities for <b>relating</b> text to such  stored assertions to generalize automatically .the teachable language comprehender  a simulation program and <b>theory</b> of language  the teachable language comprehender tlc is a program designed to be capable of being taught  to comprehend english text .the  programs strategy is presented as a general <b>theory</b> of language comprehension .<br /><b><u>CACM-1368</u></b><br /><b>Systematic Generation of Hamiltonian Circuits</b><br />systematic generation of hamiltonian <b>circuits</b>  for a combinatorial matrix which may specify both directed and nondirected arcs the paper  describes a computer program which generates systematically and exhaustively all the hamiltonian <b>circuits</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2702</u></b><br /><b>On the Complexity of LR(k) Testing</b><br />computational <b>complexity</b> context-free grammars parsing lrk grammars np-complete problems  4 .the time <b>complexity</b> of this problem  is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter  of the test .on the <b>complexity</b> of lrk testing  the problem of determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a member of some easily  parsed subclass of grammars such as the lrk grammars is considered .<br /><b><u>CACM-2342</u></b><br /><b>Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes</b><br />solutions have been given for the mutual exclusion problem and associated  subproblems in the form of <b>parallel</b> programs and informal proofs of correctness have been given for  these solutions .in this paper a system of <b>parallel</b> processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds  from one state s i .concurrent programming control cooperating processes formal programs interference mutual exclusion  operating systems <b>parallel</b> processes  4 .<br />
