<b><u>CACM-2377</u></b><br /><b>A Hardware Architecture for Implementing Protection Rings</b><br />the <b>mechanisms</b> for implementing  these rings of protection .the <b>mechanisms</b> allow cross-ring <b>calls</b> and subsequent returns to occur without  trapping to the supervisor .this paper describes  hardware processor <b>mechanisms</b> for implementing these rings of protection .<br /><b><u>CACM-3128</u></b><br /><b>Synchronization with Eventcounts and Sequencers</b><br />direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in <b>distributed</b> systems .the mechanism is defined formally and then several <b>examples</b> of its use are given .the relationship of the mechanism to protection <b>mechanisms</b> in the system is explained in particular eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters .<br /><b><u>CACM-2931</u></b><br /><b>Logic and Programming Languages</b><br />logic and programming languages  logic has been long in <b>terested</b> in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle  since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization .programming languages offer  an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced however the semantical theory  can hardly be said to be <b>complete</b> .nevertheless much remains  to be done in showing how <b>abstract</b> conceptualizations can or cannot be actualized before we can say  we have a unified theory .<br /><b><u>CACM-3043</u></b><br /><b>Distributed Processes: A Concurrent Programming Concept</b><br />the paper gives several <b>examples</b> of <b>distributed</b> <b>processes</b> and shows that they include procedures coroutines  classes monitors <b>processes</b> semaphores buffers path expressions and inputoutput as special cases .these  <b>processes</b> communicate and synchronize by means of <b>procedure</b> <b>calls</b> and guarded regions .this concept  is proposed for real-time applications controlled by microcomputer networks with <b>distributed</b> storage .<br /><b><u>CACM-2342</u></b><br /><b>Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes</b><br />in this paper a system of parallel <b>processes</b> is regarded as a machine which proceeds  from one state s i .it is shown  how to calculate transition rules from the partial rules by which the individual <b>processes</b> operate .interference between <b>communicating</b> parallel <b>processes</b>  various kinds of interference between <b>communicating</b> parallel <b>processes</b> have been examined by  dijkstra knuth and others .<br />
