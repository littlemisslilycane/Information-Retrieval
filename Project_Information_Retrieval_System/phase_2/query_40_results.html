<b><u>CACM-2956</u></b><br /><b>Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages</b><br />some ideas on <b>data</b> <b>types</b> in high-level <b>languages</b>  a number of issues are explored concerning the notion that a <b>data</b> <b>type</b> is a set of values together  with a set of primitive operations on those values .<b>data</b> <b>types</b> generic procedures programming <b>languages</b>  4 .among these are the need for a notation for iterating  over the elements of any finite set instead of the more narrow for i 1 to n notation the use of  the domain of an array as a <b>data</b> <b>type</b> the need for a simple notation for allowing <b>types</b> of parameters  to be themselves parameters but in a restrictive fashion and resulting problems with conversion of  values from one <b>type</b> to another .<br /><b><u>CACM-3105</u></b><br /><b>A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access</b><br />programming <b>languages</b> access control <b>data</b> <b>types</b> abstract <b>data</b> <b>types</b> <b>type</b> checking capabilities  4 .the constraints are stated declaratively and can  be enforced by static checking similar to <b>type</b> checking .a language extension for expressing constraints on <b>data</b> access  controlled sharing of information is needed and desirable for many applications and is supported  in operating systems by access control mechanisms .<br /><b><u>CACM-1098</u></b><br /><b>A Comparison of List-Processing Computer Languages
(Including a Detailed Comparison of COMIT, 
IPL-V, LISP 1.5, and SLIP)</b><br />a rough comparison  shows that all the <b>languages</b> discussed have approximately the same speed .important common features of list-processing <b>languages</b> are reviewed forms of <b>data</b> <b>structures</b>  which are manipulated necessity for dynamic allocation of storage use of pushdown stores and use of  recursive operations .a comparison of list-processing computer <b>languages</b> including a detailed comparison of comit  ipl-v lisp 1 .<br /><b><u>CACM-1470</u></b><br /><b>The Structure of Programming Languages</b><br />names are useful  entry points into permanent <b>data</b> <b>structures</b> but can be error-causing distractions in other contexts .he concludes by suggesting the evolution of programming <b>languages</b> toward one which  will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring programs organizing systems and referencing  <b>data</b> .many examples <b>frequently</b> from list processing <b>languages</b> illustrate the forms  described .<br /><b><u>CACM-2265</u></b><br /><b>A Model for Type Checking</b><br />in particular a program is mapped into an expression  within a decidable subset of the lambda calculus which characterizes the <b>type</b> relations within the program  and eliminates all other information .<b>type</b> checking <b>types</b> lambda calculus models for programming <b>languages</b> syntax semantics compiler  writing language implementation formal definition  4 .for correct compilation and execution the following question  then arises is a program properly constructed so that its operations and operands are compatible  the  activity of answering this question is usually called <b>type</b> checking .<br />
