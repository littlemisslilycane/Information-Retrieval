<b><u>CACM-3032</u></b><br /><b>Reverse Path Forwarding of Broadcast Packets</b><br />reverse path forwarding is a practical algorithm for broadcast <b>routing</b>   in store-and-forward <b>packet</b> switching computer <b>networks</b> .the algorithm is described as being practical   because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper and also because  it can be implemented in existing <b>networks</b> with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives .reverse path forwarding broadcast packets <b>routing</b> computer <b>networks</b> store-and-forward <b>packet</b>  switching broadcast protocols  3 .<br /><b><u>CACM-2949</u></b><br /><b>A Correctness Proof of a Topology Information
