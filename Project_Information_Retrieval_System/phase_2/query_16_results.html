<b><u>CACM-1135</u></b><br /><b>A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions*</b><br />it stresses  the structural analysis of the class of <b>processes</b> to be represented in the languages as opposed to emphasizing  formal i .a general business-oriented language <b>based</b> on decision expressions  the structure of a digital compute programming language which covers a wide class of business  and file processing applications is presented .instead of using procedure <b>descriptions</b> which are one-to-one translations  of flowcharts .<br /><b><u>CACM-0243</u></b><br /><b>N-Dimensional Codes for Detecting and Correcting Multiple Errors</b><br />the <b>message</b> itself is arranged conceptually into a multidimensional rectangular  array .the <b>processes</b> of encoding and error detection are <b>based</b> upon parity evaluations along prescribed  dimensions of the array .n-dimensional codes for detecting and correcting <b>multiple</b> errors  the paper introduces a new family of codes for detecting and correcting <b>multiple</b> errors in  a binary-coded <b>message</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3141</u></b><br /><b>An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding
in Circular Configurations of Processes</b><br />decentralized algorithms distributed <b>systems</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>  4 .this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective <b>message</b> extinction in order to achieve an average number of <b>message</b> passes of order n log n rather than on2 .an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding in circular configurations of <b>processes</b>  this note presents an improvement to lelanns algorithm for finding the largest or smallest of a set of uniquely numbered <b>processes</b> arranged in a circle in which no central controller exists and the number of <b>processes</b> is not known a priori .<br /><b><u>CACM-2378</u></b><br /><b>An Operating System Based on the Concept of a Supervisory Computer</b><br /><b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> supervisors multiprogramming time-sharing cooperating <b>processes</b>  4 .the supervisor handles io with external devices-the file and directory system-schedules  active <b>processes</b> and manages memory handle errors and provides a small set of primitive functions which  it will execute for a process .an <b>operating</b> system <b>based</b> on the concept of a supervisory computer  an <b>operating</b> system which is organized as a small supervisor and a set of independent <b>processes</b>  are described .<br /><b><u>CACM-1750</u></b><br /><b>Considerations in the Design of a Multiple
Computer System with Extended Core Storage</b><br /><b>multiple</b> computer <b>systems</b> extended core storage multiprogrammed <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> multiprocessor  <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> control data corporation 6600 <b>operating</b> system with ecs  4 .considerations in the design of a <b>multiple</b> computer system with extended core storage  the use of large quantities of addressable but not executable fast random access memory to  heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system is discussed .the general design  of the hardware arrangement and the software components and functions of such a system are <b>based</b> on a  planned configuration of dual cdc 6600s that share one million words of extended core storage .<br />
