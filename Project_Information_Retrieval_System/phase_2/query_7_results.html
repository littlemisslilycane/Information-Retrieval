<b><u>CACM-3043</u></b><br /><b>Distributed Processes: A Concurrent Programming Concept</b><br />these  <b>processes</b> <b>communicate</b> and <b>synchronize</b> by means of procedure calls and guarded regions .<b>distributed</b> <b>processes</b> a <b>concurrent</b> programming concept  a language concept for <b>concurrent</b> <b>processes</b> without common variables is introduced .the paper gives several examples of <b>distributed</b> <b>processes</b> and shows that they <b>include</b> procedures coroutines  classes monitors <b>processes</b> semaphores buffers path expressions and inputoutput as special cases .<br /><b><u>CACM-2912</u></b><br /><b>Concurrent Reading and Writing</b><br />two general  theorems are proved and some <b>algorithms</b> are presented to illustrate their use .it is assumed that only  one process at a time can modify the data but <b>concurrent</b> reading and writing is permitted .these solutions do not assume any synchronizing  mechanism other than data which can be written by one process and read by other <b>processes</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-3128</u></b><br /><b>Synchronization with Eventcounts and Sequencers</b><br />a new synchronization mechanism is proposed using  abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers that allows <b>processes</b> to control the ordering of events directly rather than using mutual exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control ordering of events .process synchronization interprocess communication <b>distributed</b> systems security models mutual exclusion semaphores  4 .direct control of ordering seems to simplify <b>correctness</b> arguments and also simplifies implementation in <b>distributed</b> systems .<br /><b><u>CACM-2949</u></b><br /><b>A Correctness Proof of a Topology Information
