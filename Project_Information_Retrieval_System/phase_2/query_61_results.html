<b><u>CACM-2711</u></b><br /><b>A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing</b><br />typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the <b>model</b> .an approach based on  <b>space</b> density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents .cacm november 1975  <b>salton</b> g .<br /><b><u>CACM-2307</u></b><br /><b>Dynamic Document Processing</b><br /><b>methods</b> are described for an automatic query modification based on user needs and for a continuous  reorganization of the stored information as a function of earlier file processing and of normal collection  growth .a new dynamic document environment is then outlined in which clustered files are searched and information is retrieved following an interactive user-controlled <b>search</b> process .cacm july 1972  <b>salton</b> g .<br /><b><u>CACM-2451</u></b><br /><b>Design of Tree Structures for Efficient Querying</b><br />tree file information storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>search</b> data structure data management  query answering  3 .the process of locating the desired responses  can be represented by a tree <b>search</b> <b>model</b> .on the other hand it is potentially  useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive  ideal <b>search</b> procedure .<br /><b><u>CACM-3134</u></b><br /><b>The Use of Normal Multiplication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval</b><br />moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the <b>inverted</b>  file technique .algorithms for the organization an d <b>retrieval</b> of information are described .several examples are given the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk <b>space</b> are compared to other common approaches .<br /><b><u>CACM-1236</u></b><br /><b>The SMART Automatic Document Retrieval System-An Illustration</b><br />the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment but also to test the effectiveness  of the various available processing <b>methods</b> .a typical <b>search</b>  request is used as an example in the present report to illustrate systems operations and evaluation procedures .cacm june 1965  <b>salton</b> g .<br />
