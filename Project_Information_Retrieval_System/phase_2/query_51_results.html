<b><u>CACM-3075</u></b><br /><b>Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms</b><br />parallel processing sorting <b>algorithms</b> bucket sort  3 .the algorithm makes use of a technique that requires more space than the product of <b>processors</b>  and time .a procedure  is also presented to sort n numbers in time ok log n using n 1  1k <b>processors</b> for k an arbitrary  integer .<br /><b><u>CACM-3156</u></b><br /><b>Computing Connected Components on Parallel Computers</b><br />computing connected components on parallel computers  we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 <b>processors</b> to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n .we assume that the <b>processors</b> have access to a common memory .an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only nnlog2n <b>processors</b> .<br /><b><u>CACM-2714</u></b><br /><b>Merging with Parallel Processors</b><br />the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel <b>processors</b>  which requires at most 2   steps .merging with parallel <b>processors</b>  consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel <b>processors</b>  working synchronously .<br /><b><u>CACM-2723</u></b><br /><b>Multiprocessing Compactifying Garbage Collection</b><br />the simple case of two <b>processors</b> one performing lisp-like list operations and the other performing  garbage collection continuously is thoroughly examined .multiprocessing compactifying garbage collection  <b>algorithms</b> for a multiprocessing compactifying garbage collector are presented and discussed .the more complex cases involving several list <b>processors</b>  and one or more garbage collection <b>processors</b> are also briefly discussed .<br /><b><u>CACM-3006</u></b><br /><b>Anomalies with Variable Partition Paging Algorithms</b><br />one type of anomaly for example concerns the fact that with certain reference strings  and <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms</b> an increase in mean memory allocation may result in an increase in fault rate .two <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms</b> are examined in terms of their anomaly potential and reference string examples  of various anomalies are presented .anomalies with variable partition <b>paging</b> <b>algorithms</b>  five types of anomalous behavior which may occur in paged virtual memory operating systems  a redefined .<br />
