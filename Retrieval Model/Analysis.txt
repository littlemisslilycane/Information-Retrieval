Overlaps:
I noticed that for the top 5 result documents for each query in Lucene and BM25 implementation are quite similar with very slight changes in rank position. For instance, the below queries have the following overlaps between the two system. They fall under the top 5 rank and relevant documents.

Query: Milky way galaxy
For this query, the documents Milky_Way,Andromeda_Galaxy and Galaxy

Query: Big bang theory
Big_Bang,Ralph_Alpher,Cosmology

Query: Hubble space telescope
Edwin_Hubble, Hubble_space_telescope 

Query:mars exploratory missions
Mars_to_Stay

There is no overlap of documents for International Space Station.


Observations:
While there is overlap, I noticed that Lucene's system of scoring produces more relevant documents since it combines the features of Boolean Model,TF/IDF and vector space model. Besides, apart from the content of the document, it considers the document name/title(a field) and boosts per query term. Documents are thus fielded in Lucene , which makes it better.

For instance, the query results for "International Space station" did not have any common documents between Lucene and BM25 implementation. Lucene offered more relevant documents such as Orbital_Technologies_Commercial_Space_Station,Outline of space science, Space_station where as our BM25 implementation produced very less relevant documents such as Nanjing, History of Antartica, Venera etc.,
