Design:

1)I have implemented BM25 retrieval model in Java. These are the steps I followed:
	a)Get the indexes for the corpus.
	b)Compute the query-term frequency.
	c)For each document in the list, computed the BM25 score with the standard formula (for each query term and summed up the score).
	d)Sort the documents in the descending order of their scores.

I have used Hash-maps to store the document score data.

2)I have used Lucene 4.7.2 Standard Analyzer to index and get the top 100 documents for each query results with respect to Lucene retrieval model
